 <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-bold"> Source: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/steps-to-take-now-to-get-a-jump-on-next-years-taxes">https://www.irs.gov/individuals/steps-to-take-now-to-get-a-jump-on-next-years-taxes</a> </p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Changes in the number of dependents, employment or self-employment income and divorce, among other factors, may affect your tax-filing status and refund.  

No additional stimulus payments. Unlike 2020 and 2021, there were no new stimulus payments for 2022 so taxpayers should not expect to get an additional payment.   

Some tax credits return to 2019 levels. This means that taxpayers will likely receive a significantly smaller refund compared with the previous tax year. Changes include amounts for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child and Dependent Care Credit will revert to pre-COVID levels.  

For 2022, the CTC is worth $2,000 for each qualifying child. A child must be under age 17 at the end of 2022 to be a qualifying child.
For the EITC, eligible taxpayers with no children may get $560 for the 2022 tax year.
For the Child and Dependent Care Credit, taxpayers may receive up to 35% of their employment expenses for 2022. Visit Credits and Deductions for more details.

No above-the-line charitable deductions. During COVID, taxpayers were able to take up to a $600 charitable donation tax deduction on their tax returns. However, for tax year 2022, taxpayers who don’t itemize and who take the standard deduction, won’t be able to deduct their charitable contributions.

More people may be eligible for the Premium Tax Credit. For tax year 2022, taxpayers may qualify for temporarily expanded eligibility for the premium tax credit. Remember that simply meeting the income requirements does not mean you're eligible for the premium tax credit. You must also meet the other eligibility criteria.

Eligibility rules changed to claim a tax credit for clean vehicles. Review the changes under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 to qualify for a Clean Vehicle Credit.</p>

Whether of not the life became intelligent is a different question, and we'll see if we find that.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For me, the most fascinating interface is Twitter. I have odd cosmic thoughts every day and I realized I could hold them to myself or share them with people who might be interested.</p>

I kind of want to know what happened there because we're twirling knobs here on Earth without knowing the consequences of it. Mars once had running water. It's bone dry today. Something bad happened there as well.</p>
